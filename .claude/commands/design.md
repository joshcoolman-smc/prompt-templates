description: Create or refine a design system based on aesthetic direction
---

I need to create a design system for: $ARGUMENTS

## My Role

I'm your design consultant. I'll help translate your aesthetic vision into a concrete design system with fonts, colors, spacing, and component patterns.

## Initial Assessment

First, let me evaluate if I have enough information to proceed:

**If you've provided clear direction** (like "modern and minimal like Apple" or "warm and organic like a yoga studio"), I'll start executing immediately.

**If your request is vague** (like "make it nicer" or "better design"), I need to ask you some questions first:

### Design Direction Questions

1. **Aesthetic Style** - Which direction resonates with you?
   - Modern & Minimal (clean lines, generous whitespace, Swiss design)
   - Classic & Elegant (refined typography, sophisticated, timeless)
   - Warm & Approachable (organic shapes, friendly, welcoming)
   - Bold & Energetic (high contrast, dynamic, athletic)
   - Editorial & Literary (magazine-inspired, strong typography)
   - Tech & Futuristic (geometric, precise, cutting-edge)

2. **Emotional Tone** - How should it feel?
   - Serious and professional / Playful and casual
   - Luxurious and premium / Accessible and friendly
   - Calm and meditative / Energetic and exciting
   - Traditional and trustworthy / Innovative and modern

3. **Reference Points** - Any brands or sites you admire?
   - Specific websites, apps, or brands whose aesthetic you like
   - Competitors you want to differentiate from

4. **Target Audience** - Who is this for?
   - Demographics, preferences, expectations

## Design System Framework

Once I understand your vision, I'll create a complete design system including:

### Typography System

**Font Selection Strategy:**
- Translate brand mood into font characteristics
- Modern/minimal → geometric sans-serifs (Inter, DM Sans, Outfit)
- Elegant/luxury → refined serifs (Cormorant, Playfair Display, Lora)
- Warm/organic → humanist fonts (Nunito, Quicksand, Open Sans)
- Editorial → classic combinations (Merriweather + Montserrat, Crimson Text + Work Sans)
- Tech/futuristic → geometric precision (Space Grotesk, Exo 2, Orbitron)

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Define font pairings (heading, subheading, body)
- Specify weights and when to use them
- Set up proper hierarchy and line heights
- Include technical/mono fonts if needed

### Color System

**Color Psychology Application:**
- Modern/minimal → monochromatic with one accent (grays + single color)
- Elegant → high contrast or muted earth tones
- Warm → earth tones, oranges, warm neutrals
- Bold → high contrast, vibrant accents
- Professional → blues, grays, conservative palette
- Creative → diverse, expressive color choices

**Color Specifications:**
- Background hierarchy (page, container, card levels)
- Text contrast levels (headings, body, metadata)
- Accent colors for interactive elements
- State colors (success, warning, error)
- Ensure WCAG accessibility standards

### Spacing & Layout

**Spacing Rhythm:**
- Modern/minimal → generous, breathing room (larger gaps)
- Dense/editorial → tighter, efficient (smaller gaps)
- Luxury → asymmetric, unexpected spacing
- Standard → 4pt or 8pt grid system

**Layout Principles:**
- Grid systems appropriate to aesthetic
- Container widths and padding
- Component spacing patterns
- Responsive breakpoint strategy

### Component Patterns

**Based on aesthetic direction:**
- Button styles (filled, outline, ghost)
- Form input styling (bordered, underlined, filled)
- Card/container treatments
- Navigation patterns
- Interactive states and transitions

## Technical Implementation

### Next.js + Tailwind + Google Fonts Setup

I'll provide ready-to-implement code:

1. **Font Setup** - next/font/google imports with CSS variables
2. **Tailwind Config** - Custom colors, fonts, and spacing
3. **Component Classes** - Reusable Tailwind patterns
4. **Design Tokens** - Systematic values for consistency

## Design Principles to Follow

**Consistency:** Systematic spacing, predictable patterns
**Hierarchy:** Clear visual organization through size, weight, color
**Accessibility:** WCAG contrast ratios, semantic HTML, focus states
**Performance:** Optimized font loading, efficient CSS
**Flexibility:** Design system that scales with the application

## My Approach

1. **Understand your vision** (ask questions if needed)
2. **Translate aesthetics into concrete choices** (fonts, colors, spacing)
3. **Create systematic design tokens** (not random values)
4. **Provide implementation code** (ready to use)
5. **Iterate based on your feedback** (refine until it's right)

## Example Brand Translations

To give you confidence in my interpretations:

**"Like Apple/Modern/Minimal"** → SF Pro or Inter, monochromatic grays, generous spacing, subtle shadows, precise alignment

**"Like Vogue/Editorial"** → Playfair Display + Montserrat, high contrast black/white, dramatic typography scale, editorial grid

**"Like Airbnb/Friendly"** → Circular or Nunito, warm pinks/corals, approachable spacing, rounded corners, soft shadows

**"Like Stripe/Tech"** → Inter or DM Sans, blue/purple accents, clean grid, precise spacing, sophisticated interactions

**"Like Kinfolk/Organic"** → Crimson Text + Open Sans, earth tones, generous whitespace, natural imagery, soft aesthetics

**"Like Nike/Athletic"** → Futura or Outfit, bold blacks with single accent, dynamic layouts, energetic spacing, strong contrast

Now, let me assess your request: **$ARGUMENTS**

Based on this, I'll either start executing with smart design choices, or ask you for more specific direction. Let's create something great!
