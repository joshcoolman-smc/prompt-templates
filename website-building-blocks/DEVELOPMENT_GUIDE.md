# Website Development Guide

This document provides guidance on how to effectively use the prompt templates in this repository to build a complete website. It covers the development workflow, dependencies between components, and best practices for implementation.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

Before starting implementation:

- Review all prompt templates to understand the full scope
- Identify customizations you'll need for your specific project
- Gather design assets (colors, typography, logo, images)
- Define site content and key user flows
### 2. Implementation Sequence

Follow this recommended sequence for implementation:

#### Foundation (Phase 1)
1. Set up Vite project with TypeScript
2. Establish project structure and organization
3. Configure routing
4. Set up TypeScript configuration
5. Implement basic styling infrastructure

#### Design System (Phase 2)
1. Define color palette
2. Establish typography
3. Create spacing system
4. Set up responsive breakpoints
5. Build base components

#### Core Components (Phase 3)
1. Create global header
2. Implement global footer
3. Build card component variants
4. Create button system
5. Develop form elements
6. Implement modal system
#### Page Templates (Phase 4)
1. Build home page
2. Create about page
3. Implement contact page
4. Develop gallery/portfolio page
5. Build blog post template

### 3. Testing Milestones

Conduct thorough testing at these key milestones:

- After completing Phase 1: Verify basic functionality and navigation
- After completing Phase 2: Review design system for consistency
- After completing each core component: Test across devices and scenarios
- After completing each page template: Test for responsive behavior and integration

## Component Dependencies

Understanding the dependencies between components will help you plan your implementation:

```
Foundation
└── Design System
    └── Core Components
        └── Page Templates
```

More specifically:

- **Header Component** depends on Button Component and Color System
- **Footer Component** depends on Typography and Spacing System
- **Card Component** depends on Typography, Colors, and Spacing
- **Home Page** depends on Header, Footer, Cards, and Buttons
- **Contact Page** depends on Header, Footer, and Form Elements
## Customization Guidelines

When adapting these templates to your specific needs:

### Design Customization
- Replace placeholder colors with your brand colors
- Update typography to match your brand fonts
- Adjust spacing and sizing to your design preferences
- Customize component styling while maintaining consistency

### Structural Customization
- Add or remove sections from page templates as needed
- Extend components with additional variants
- Create new specialized components as required
- Modify routing structure for your content organization

### Functional Customization
- Add state management for complex features
- Integrate with backend services via API calls
- Add authentication if required
- Implement analytics and tracking

## Code Organization

As your project grows, maintain a clean structure:

```
src/
├── assets/              # Images, fonts, static files
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Base UI components
│   └── [feature]/       # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── layouts/             # Page layout templates
├── pages/               # Route-based page components
├── styles/              # Global styles and theme
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/               # Helper functions
```
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Inconsistent Styling**: Ensure all components follow your design system
- **Prop Explosion**: Avoid creating components with too many props
- **Premature Optimization**: Build for clarity first, then optimize performance
- **Inaccessible Components**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Rigid Implementations**: Build components flexible enough to adapt to changing requirements

## Extending Beyond the Templates

Once you've implemented the base website, consider these enhancements:

- **Animation System**: Add consistent transitions and animations
- **CMS Integration**: Connect to a headless CMS for content management
- **Multi-language Support**: Implement i18n for internationalization
- **Advanced State Management**: Add Context API or Redux for complex state
- **SEO Optimization**: Implement meta tags, structured data, and sitemap
- **Performance Enhancements**: Add code splitting, lazy loading, and caching

## Maintaining Your Website

After initial development:

- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current with security patches
- **Code Reviews**: Periodically review and refactor code for improvements
- **Performance Audits**: Use tools like Lighthouse to identify optimizations
- **User Feedback**: Collect and incorporate user feedback for improvements
- **Analytics Review**: Use analytics data to guide feature development

## Using AI Assistance Effectively

When working with AI assistants on these prompts:

- **Provide Clear Context**: Share your existing code and specific requirements
- **Ask Specific Questions**: Focus on particular implementation challenges
- **Review Generated Code**: Understand and verify all generated code
- **Iterate**: Request refinements to improve the implementation
- **Learn**: Use the process to enhance your understanding of the techniques

By following this guide, you'll be able to efficiently build a professional, maintainable website using the prompt templates in this repository.
