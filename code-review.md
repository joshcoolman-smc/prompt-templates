## Review Questions to Address

### Functionality
1. Does the code accomplish its intended purpose?
2. Are all requirements met?
3. Are there any logical errors or bugs?
4. Does it handle edge cases appropriately?

### Maintainability
1. How easy would this code be to modify in the future?
2. Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?
3. Is the code self-documenting or well-commented?
4. Would a new team member understand this code?

### Integration
1. How does this code interact with existing systems?
2. Are there any breaking changes?
3. Is backward compatibility maintained?
4. Are APIs and interfaces properly defined?

## Feedback Format

### For each issue found, provide:
1. **Severity Level**: 
   - ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Must be fixed (security, functionality)
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Important**: Should be fixed (performance, maintainability)
   - ðŸ”µ **Suggestion**: Nice to have (style, optimization)

2. **Location**: Specific file and line number if applicable

3. **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue

4. **Recommendation**: Specific suggestion for improvement

5. **Example**: Code example showing the recommended fix

### Example Feedback Entry:
**ðŸŸ¡ Important - Component Re-renders**
- **Location**: `src/components/UserProfile.tsx:45`
- **Issue**: Component re-renders on every parent update due to inline object creation
- **Recommendation**: Move the style object outside the component or use useMemo
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  // Instead of:
  <div style={{padding: '10px', margin: '5px'}}>
  
  // Use:
  const containerStyle = {padding: '10px', margin: '5px'};
  <div style={containerStyle}>
  ```
