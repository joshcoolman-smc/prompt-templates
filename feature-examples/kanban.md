# Simplified Kanban Board Feature Brief

## Overview
Create a simplified Kanban-style project management board similar to GitHub Projects for small teams of up to 3 people. The board should provide a visual representation of work in progress, allowing team members to track tasks as they move through different stages of completion.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Features
- Board layout with customizable status columns
- Task creation with title and description
- Task assignment to team members (up to 3 people)
- Drag and drop functionality between columns
- Task editing and deletion
- Custom column creation beyond defaults
- Optional deadline setting for tasks
- Filtering tasks by assignee
- Label/tag system for task categorization

### Stretch Goals
- Voice command integration for task creation and editing
- AI-assisted task description generation
- AI-suggested task categorization and status
- AI-powered task prioritization based on deadlines and content

## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure
- Task: id, title, description, status, assignee, deadline (optional), createdAt, updatedAt, labels/tags (array)
- Column: id, name, order
- User: id, name, email
- Label/Tag: id, name, color

### UI Components
- Board container
- Column component with "+" button at the bottom for adding new tasks
- Task card component (draggable)
- Task creation/edit modal
- Column creation/edit modal
- Drag handle indicators for tasks

### Default Columns
- To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

### Functionality
- Drag and drop interface for moving tasks between columns (similar to GitHub Projects)
- Ability to create new tasks directly in any column by clicking a "+" icon at the bottom of each column
- Ability to create, edit, and delete tasks
- Ability to create, edit, and delete columns (with the default columns provided)
- Ability to assign tasks to team members (from a list of 3 predefined users)
- Optional deadline setting for tasks

## Design Guidelines
- Follow existing design system using shadcn components
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Ensure dark mode compatibility
- Use Lucide React icons for UI elements
- Create a clean, minimal interface that prioritizes usability
- Include filtering controls in the board header
- Use subtle color coding for labels/tags
- Implement visual indicators for task deadlines
- Provide clear visual feedback during drag operations

## Implementation Notes
- Implement using the feature module pattern
- Create appropriate repository and service interfaces
- Use Zod for data validation
- Implement client components for interactive elements
- Implement drag and drop functionality using a library like dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd
- Keep page routes as server components
- Generate sufficient mock data for testing all features
- Ensure smooth animations during drag operations

### AI and Voice Integration (Stretch Goal)
- Integrate with a speech-to-text API for voice command functionality
- Leverage AI APIs (like OpenAI) for task generation and categorization
- Implement simple NLP to detect task intent from voice input
- Create a voice command handler to process spoken CRUD operations

## Mock Data Requirements
- Create mock data for at least 3 users
- Generate 10-15 sample tasks distributed across the default columns
- Include variety in task details, assignees, and deadlines

## Constraints
- Feature should work for small teams (maximum 3 users)
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use rather than extensive functionality
- No notification system required at this stage
- No external integrations required at this stage
