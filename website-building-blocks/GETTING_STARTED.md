# Getting Started with Interactive Website Building

This guide explains how to use these templates with an AI assistant to interactively build a complete website.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

1. A fresh Vite React application with TypeScript
2. Tailwind CSS installed and configured
3. Basic project structure in place

```bash
# If you need to create a new project:
npm create vite@latest my-website -- --template react-ts
cd my-website

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Install React Router
npm install react-router-dom
```

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Add these templates** to your project root directory
2. **Ask your AI assistant** to help build your website using these templates
3. **Follow the interactive process** outlined below

## Interactive Building Process

The AI will guide you through a series of phases, each building upon the previous one:

### Phase 1: Project Structure & Navigation

The AI will:
- Ask about your site's main sections
- Help establish proper folder structure for features
- Create a responsive navigation component
- Request your approval before moving to the next phase

### Phase 2: Design System

The AI will:
- Ask about your brand colors and preferences
- Help create a complete color palette
- Set up typography and spacing systems
- Show previews for your approval

### Phase 3: Core Components

The AI will:
- Build essential UI components like cards, buttons, etc.
- Customize based on your specific needs
- Ensure components follow accessibility guidelines
- Get your feedback on each component

### Phase 4: Page Templates

The AI will:
- Combine components to create complete pages
- Build responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Implement proper routing between pages
- Request your approval on each page

## Recommended Folder Structure

The AI will help establish this domain-based organization:

```
src/
├── features/           # Domain-specific features
│   ├── home/           # Home page feature
│   ├── about/          # About feature
│   ├── contact/        # Contact feature
│   └── [other-features]/
├── components/         # Shared components
│   ├── ui/             # Base UI components
│   └── layout/         # Layout components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── styles/             # Global styles and theme
├── utils/              # Helper functions
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Human Feedback Loop

At each stage, you'll be able to:
1. Provide specific requirements
2. Review implemented code
3. Request changes if needed
4. Approve to move to the next phase

This ensures the website meets your exact needs and gives you control over the development process.

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about any step, ask the AI assistant for:
- Explanations of the current phase
- Previews of what's being implemented
- Reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Options for customization

## Next Steps

Once your AI assistant has access to these templates, simply say "Let's start building my website" to begin the interactive process.
