# Interactive Website Building Workflow

This document outlines an interactive, checkpoint-based approach to building a website with AI assistance, allowing for human feedback and approval at each step.

## Workflow Structure

Each component follows this consistent pattern:

1. **Information gathering** - Interactive questions to establish requirements
2. **Initial implementation** - AI generates the code based on responses
3. **Preview/review** - User examines implemented component
4. **Explicit approval** - User confirms to proceed to next phase

## Phase 1: Navigation

### Step 1.1: Requirements Gathering
```
AI: "Let's start building your website navigation. What are the main sections of your site?"
User: [Lists sections like "Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact"]

AI: "Would you like any dropdown menus for these sections?"
User: [Provides details about dropdown structure]

AI: "Do you have a logo you'd like to include in the navigation?"
User: [Provides logo information or declines]
```

### Step 1.2: Implementation
```
AI: "Based on your answers, I'll create a navigation component with [details]. Let me implement this for you..."
[AI generates navigation code and previews it]
```

### Step 1.3: Review and Approval
```
AI: "Here's a preview of your navigation component. Is this structure what you had in mind?"
User: [Provides feedback or requests changes]

AI: [Makes adjustments if needed]

AI: "Does the navigation look good now? Shall we move on to defining your color palette?"
User: "Yes, let's move to colors"
```

## Phase 2: Color Palette

### Step 2.1: Requirements Gathering
```
AI: "Let's establish your website's color palette. Do you have specific brand colors you'd like to use?"
User: [Provides color codes or general preferences]

AI: "What mood should your color scheme convey? (professional, playful, energetic, calming, etc.)"
User: [Describes desired mood]

AI: "Would you like a light theme, dark theme, or both?"
User: [Specifies preference]
```

### Step 2.2: Implementation
```
AI: "Based on your preferences, here's a proposed color palette:"
[AI generates and displays color palette with primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors]
```

### Step 2.3: Review and Approval
```
AI: "How does this palette look? Would you like to adjust any colors?"
User: [Provides feedback or approval]

AI: [Makes adjustments if needed]

AI: "Are you happy with this color palette? Shall we move on to typography?"
User: "Yes, let's define typography"
```

## Phase 3: Typography

### Step 3.1: Requirements Gathering
```
AI: "Let's choose typography for your website. Do you prefer serif or sans-serif fonts for headings?"
User: [Specifies preference]

AI: "And for body text, which would you prefer?"
User: [Specifies preference]

AI: "Do you have specific fonts in mind, or would you like recommendations?"
User: [Provides specific fonts or requests suggestions]
```

### Step 3.2: Implementation
```
AI: "Based on your preferences, here's a proposed typography system:"
[AI generates and displays typography examples with headings and body text]
```

### Step 3.3: Review and Approval
```
AI: "How does this typography look? Would you like to make any adjustments?"
User: [Provides feedback or approval]

AI: [Makes adjustments if needed]

AI: "Are you satisfied with the typography? Shall we move on to creating the card components?"
User: "Yes, let's build the cards"
```

## Phase 4: Card Components

### Step 4.1: Requirements Gathering
```
AI: "Let's design card components for your website. What types of content will your cards display?"
User: [Describes content types like products, blog posts, team members, etc.]

AI: "Would you prefer flat cards or cards with shadows/elevation?"
User: [Specifies preference]

AI: "Do you need interactive cards (clickable/hoverable)?"
User: [Specifies preference]
```

### Step 4.2: Implementation
```
AI: "Based on your requirements, here are card component designs:"
[AI generates and displays different card variants]
```

### Step 4.3: Review and Approval
```
AI: "How do these card designs look? Would you like any adjustments?"
User: [Provides feedback or approval]

AI: [Makes adjustments if needed]

AI: "Are you happy with these card components? Shall we move on to building a complete page?"
User: "Yes, let's build a page"
```

## Phase 5: Home Page

### Step 5.1: Requirements Gathering
```
AI: "Let's design your home page. What sections should it include?"
User: [Lists sections like hero, features, testimonials, etc.]

AI: "What's the main message you want to convey on your home page?"
User: [Describes main value proposition]

AI: "Would you like a full-width hero section with a background image?"
User: [Specifies preference]
```

### Step 5.2: Implementation
```
AI: "Based on your requirements, here's a design for your home page:"
[AI generates and displays home page layout]
```

### Step 5.3: Review and Approval
```
AI: "How does this home page design look? Would you like any adjustments?"
User: [Provides feedback or approval]

AI: [Makes adjustments if needed]

AI: "Are you satisfied with the home page? Shall we move on to additional pages?"
User: "Yes, let's continue with more pages"
```

## Additional Phase Examples

Additional phases could follow the same pattern for:

- About page
- Contact form
- Services/features section
- Portfolio/gallery
- Footer component
- Mobile responsiveness review
- Animation/transitions
- Performance optimization

## Controller Logic

The workflow controller should:

1. Track current phase and step
2. Store user responses for reference
3. Provide context to the AI for each phase
4. Remember previous design decisions to maintain consistency
5. Allow returning to previous phases for adjustments

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Incremental progress** with clear milestones
- **Continuous feedback** prevents going too far in the wrong direction
- **Educational value** as users see the systematic process of building a website
- **Flexibility** to adapt to different website types and requirements
- **Visibility** into the development process for non-technical users
