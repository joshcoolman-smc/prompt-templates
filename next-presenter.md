# Markdown-to-Presentation Feature Brief

## Overview
Create a feature that allows users to paste markdown text and convert it into a visually compelling presentation with slides. The feature should prioritize speed and efficiency for last-minute presentation preparation while applying good presentation principles automatically.

## User Story
As a busy professional preparing for a team meeting on short notice, I want to paste markdown content and have it automatically converted into a well-structured, visually appealing presentation that I can present within an hour of creation.

## Core Requirements

### Input Handling
- Accept pasted markdown text of any length
- Support standard markdown syntax (headings, lists, code blocks, images, etc.)
- Provide a simple interface for pasting or dragging markdown files
- Support direct file upload of .md files

### Processing & AI Features
- Intelligently split content across appropriate number of slides to avoid information overload
- Apply presentation best practices automatically:
  - Limit text density per slide
  - Extract key points from paragraphs
  - Convert lists to digestible bullet points
  - Ensure consistent heading hierarchy
  - Suggest visual elements where appropriate
- Preserve code blocks with syntax highlighting when present
- Maintain semantic structure of the original content
- Process content rapidly (target: under 30 seconds for typical documents)

### Output & Presentation
- Generate presentation with dark background and light text by default
- Implement keyboard navigation controls (arrows, space, esc, etc.)
- Support presenter mode with speaker notes
- Enable full-screen presentation mode optimized for screen sharing
- Provide slide thumbnails for quick navigation
- Include progress indicator (current slide/total slides)
- Render responsive design that works well on various screen sizes

### User Controls
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Arrow keys for navigation (left/right to move between slides)
  - Space to advance
  - ESC to exit presentation mode
  - 'O' for overview/thumbnail grid
  - 'F' for fullscreen toggle
  - 'N' for speaker notes
- Minimal UI controls that don't distract during presentation

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Implementation
- Next.js with App Router
- Client Components for presentation interaction
- React-based presentation library (explore options):
  - Reveal.js (via react-reveal)
  - Spectacle
  - MDX-Deck
  - or custom implementation using React Spring/Framer Motion
- Tailwind for styling with dark mode support via next-themes
- Lucide React icons for UI elements

### Architecture Approach
- Feature module pattern: `/src/app/features/presentation/`
- Repository for handling markdown parsing and transformation
- Service layer for AI processing and slide generation
- Client components for slide rendering and controls
- Zod schemas for validated slide structure types

### AI Processing Service
- Text chunking based on semantic meaning and natural breaks
- Heading-based hierarchy detection for slide organization
- Content density analysis to determine slide breaks
- Apply typography best practices (character count per line, lines per slide)
- Extract key phrases for slide titles when needed

### Example Module Structure

```

## User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to presentation creation page
2. User pastes markdown text or uploads markdown file
3. System processes the content, applying presentation principles
4. Preview of generated slides appears with thumbnails
5. User can make minor adjustments if needed (optional)
6. User enters presentation mode with keyboard controls
7. User presents directly from the browser during their meeting

## Success Metrics
- Speed of conversion (target: < 30 seconds for typical documents)
- Readability of generated slides (appropriate text density)
- User satisfaction with presentation quality
- Time saved compared to manual presentation creation

## Stretch Goals
- Customizable themes beyond default dark mode
- Export to PowerPoint/PDF formats
- Image optimization and smart placement
- Slide transition effects that can be toggled
- Template saving for consistent presentations
- Collaborative presentation sharing

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on simplicity and speed over extensive customization options
- Prioritize keyboard controls for seamless presentation
- Ensure smooth performance even with large markdown documents
- Design for accessibility and readability
