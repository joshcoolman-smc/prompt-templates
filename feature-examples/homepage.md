# Premium Homepage Design Project

## Role & Purpose
Create a well-designed, convincing homepage with non-functional links to other sections. This homepage will establish the design language, brand style, and tone that will guide the development of other site sections later.

## Design Standards
Design aesthetic should reflect top-tier brands like:
- Apple (clean, minimal)
- Nike (bold, premium)
- Spotify (modern, intuitive)
- Etsy (warm, thoughtful)
- Airbnb (accessible, delightful)

Visual quality is paramount for stakeholder evaluation and establishing the foundation for future sections.

## Technical Requirements

### Component Framework
- Use shadcn/ui components primarily
- Extend with custom styling when needed
- Import format: `import { Component } from "@/components/ui/component"`

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Use Tailwind's color system (no custom CSS colors)
- Support dark (default) and light modes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Visual Elements
- Use lucide-react for icons
- Suggest SVG for custom illustrations
- Maintain consistent visual language

### Animations & Interactions
- Use Motion (https://motion.dev) for animations
- Implement thoughtful micro-interactions
- Create smooth, physics-based animations
- Include hover effects and transitions

### Structure
```
/features/homepage/
├── components/     # Homepage-specific components
├── hooks/          # React hooks
├── animations/     # Motion animations
└── utils/          # Utilities
```

### Constraints
- Function as standalone module
- Use pnpm for packages
- Install Motion: `pnpm add motion`

## Deliverables

### Homepage Components
- Hero section with compelling value proposition
- Navigation bar with links to future sections (non-functional)
- Key feature highlights or product showcases
- Call-to-action sections
- Footer with company information and additional links
- All components properly typed and commented
- Use shadcn/ui where possible
- All as client components

### Interactive Elements
- Realistic client-side interactivity for homepage elements
- Hover states, animations, transitions
- Polished micro-interactions

### Visual Polish & Animation
- Meticulous attention to details
- Consistent Tailwind colors that define the brand palette
- High-quality Motion animations
- Purposeful transitions between states
- Natural-feeling motion with appropriate physics
- Support dark and light modes

### Design System Documentation
- Document the established color palette
- Typography scale and usage guidelines
- Component patterns and usage examples
- Animation principles and standards
- This documentation will guide future section development

## Implementation Approach
1. Create homepage directory structure
2. Design the navigation structure with links to future sections
3. Build homepage UI components from bottom up
4. Design animation variants with Motion
5. Assemble complete homepage UI with interactive elements
6. Integrate Motion animations for hero, navigation, and key sections
7. Refine animations for natural feel
8. Ensure responsive design across all device sizes
9. Verify dark/light mode support
10. Document the established design system for future sections

## Future Development Plan
- Once the homepage design is approved, we'll build out other sections one at a time
- Each new section will follow the design language established by the homepage
- Specific requirements for each section will be determined when we reach that phase
- Components will be reused and extended to maintain consistency across the site

## Final Notes
- Focus on creating a compelling, visually striking homepage that establishes brand identity
- Prioritize visual quality and attention to detail
- Create world-class animations with Motion that set the tone for the site
- Consider accessibility including reduced motion preferences
- Include thoughtful micro-interactions that enhance the premium feel
- Balance visual delight with performance and usability
- This homepage will serve as the foundation and "north star" for all future design work
