# Stop Googling and Start Managing AI

We need to rethink how we do everything in the age of AI. We’re too used to doing everything ourselves, hunting down links, piecing together information manually. Instead, think of yourself as a researcher with assistance. Have AI agents do the work and come back to you with results.

## The Manager Mindset

Lean into AI for everything—investigation, research, reading and analyzing web pages. This is where everything is heading anyway.

View yourself as someone with a team of assistants, not someone who has to do it all. You manage the work instead of doing the work. This requires a different approach to tasks and information gathering.

## Context Engineering

This is Context Engineering—building up comprehensive context around your ideas by gathering information with AI. It’s not just having AI do things for you. It’s about engaging with AI to create something better.

You curate and distill information, then present it back to AI for maximum effectiveness. Create a comprehensive information package that would allow anyone with a clean slate to execute your vision.

## The Four Pillars

**1. Clear Objectives**
Sharp thinking about what you’re after. Vague requests yield vague results. Clear objectives make AI assistance powerful.

**2. Active Engagement**
Read and understand what AI gives you. This is an active conversation. Engage, question, and refine.

**3. Higher-Level Synthesis**
Distill information. Map out plans. Clarify concepts. Answer follow-up questions. Operate at the strategic level while AI handles tactical research.

**4. Context Reframing**
Constantly reorient what you’re gathering. Ask: “How would I want this information presented if I were starting fresh? What context would I need to complete this task?”

## Plan Your Work and Work Your Plan

When you stop doing manual information gathering and start managing AI responses with discernment, you can operate at a higher level. Your capabilities expand because you’re not bottlenecked by research tasks.

Your plan-building abilities level up. You think like an architect, not a construction worker. Design the blueprint while AI assistants gather materials and help with construction.

## AI as Collaborator, Not Gopher

AI is not a task master or a gopher. It’s a collaborator. Think of it like this: you’re on a basketball court practicing your dribble and LeBron James shows up. You don’t tell him what to do. You ask him how you can improve. You ask what you’re doing wrong.

That’s the mindshift you need. With Google it was “go get me this,” “do this for me,” “where can I find this?” Then you did the work. Now you have intelligence waiting to assist you.

If you just tell AI to do stupid things, it will do them. It probably won’t give you better results than if you had done it yourself. It might even do worse.

But if you engage in conversation saying “hey, this is what I’m thinking. What am I missing? How can I improve this? Do you think there’s a better approach?” you get valuable information back. This helps you better articulate what you’re after.

Start with vague information gathering, then narrow your focus. Ask clarifying questions. Build up context for yourself, then turn it back so AI has enough context to execute effectively on your requests.

You can’t just come out of the gate saying “do x, y, z for me.” You need to build up context first.

## Getting Started

Begin small. Next time you face a research task, resist the urge to open Google. Frame your objective clearly and have a conversation with AI about it. Let it do the searching, reading, and initial synthesis. Your job is to guide, refine, and orchestrate that information into something actionable.

You’re not just collecting information—you’re engineering context. In a world where information is abundant but understanding is scarce, context engineering is the most valuable skill you can develop.
