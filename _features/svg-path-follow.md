Create a Curved SVG Path Scroll Tracker with Follower Circle
Create an elegant scroll tracker for a parallax website that features:
1. A curved SVG path that weaves through section markers
2. A glowing white circle that follows the curved path as the user scrolls
3. Section indicator dots positioned along the path
4. Smooth animations and transitions
## Implementation Details:
- Create an SVG element fixed to the left side of the viewport
- Draw a curved path that alternates right-left-right-left between section points
- Add section indicator dots at regular intervals along the vertical axis
- Implement a follower circle that moves along the curved path based on scroll position
- Highlight the active section dot based on the current scroll position
- Ensure the SVG viewBox is wide enough to show the full curved path
## Key JavaScript Logic:
- Use SVG's `getPointAtLength()` method to calculate the follower's position along the path
- Calculate scroll percentage to determine how far along the path the follower should be
- Update the follower's position on scroll events
- Detect which section is currently in view to highlight the corresponding dot
## CSS/Styling:
- Make the path semi-transparent white
- Add a glow effect to the follower circle
- Use opacity and size transitions for the section dots
- Ensure the tracker is only visible on medium and larger screens
## Example Path Structure:
```javascriptreact
// Calculate dot positions
const sectionDotPositions = sections.map((_, index) =>
  20 + (560 / (sections.length - 1)) * index
);
// Create alternating curved path
const pathData = `M15 ${sectionDotPositions[0]}
  C30 ${midpoint(0, 1)}, 30 ${midpoint(0, 1)}, 15 ${sectionDotPositions[1]}
  C0 ${midpoint(1, 2)}, 0 ${midpoint(1, 2)}, 15 ${sectionDotPositions[2]}
  C30 ${midpoint(2, 3)}, 30 ${midpoint(2, 3)}, 15 ${sectionDotPositions[3]}
  C0 ${midpoint(3, 4)}, 0 ${midpoint(3, 4)}, 15 ${sectionDotPositions[4]}`;
// Helper function to calculate midpoints
function midpoint(index1, index2) {
  return (sectionDotPositions[index1] + sectionDotPositions[index2]) / 2;
}
```
## Scroll Handling:
```javascriptreact
// On scroll
const scrollPercentage = window.scrollY / (document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight);
const pathLength = pathElement.getTotalLength();
const point = pathElement.getPointAtLength(pathLength * scrollPercentage);
// Update follower position
followerElement.setAttribute("cx", point.x);
followerElement.setAttribute("cy", point.y);
```
This implementation creates a visually appealing scroll tracker that adds a touch of elegance to your parallax website while providing users with a clear indication of their progress through the content.
